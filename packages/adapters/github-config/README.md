# GitHub Config

The GitHub config provides you with a high-level interface for GitHub augmentation. The adapter provides styles for widgets which can be inserted into specific types of contexts. In one dapplet, you can augment different contexts with these widgets.

You can learn more about the adapter by visiting the [documentation](https://docs.dapplets.org/docs/adapters-docs-list#name=github-config.dapplet-base.eth&title=GitHub%20Config&version=v0.1.0).
